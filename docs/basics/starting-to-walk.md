The code examples expect knowledge of [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) and uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as the rendering engine.

If you’re comfortable with using these technologies to create a build ready for the browser then jump to the [getting started](getting-started.html) section, alternatively the [installation](installation.html) section has a bit more info about getting set up.
