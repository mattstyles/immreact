Rather than being driven by a framework, Raid should be considered a small library that compliments your application.\nRaid makes this possible by holding the application state inside the fold function of a data stream, the flow of the application then becomes a stream which accepts update events and emits a state tree. All mutations, or updates, have to go through the stream which enforces top-down rendering.\nTop-down rendering is perfect for use with React and whilst React is not a hard dependency, Raid was created with it in mind.\n"},"philosophy.html":{"url":"philosophy.html","title":"Philosophy","keywords":"","body":"Philosophy\n\nSmall module philosophy: Raid aims to do just one thing well, namely, create an event stream that holds state in a fold function, away from untimely mutation.\nStanding on the shoulders of giants: Raid builds on other modules which do one core thing well.\nOPEN open source: if it works its because a community makes it work. There’s no arrogance here.\nKeep the complex away from the consumer: Raid should make life easier for developers by being both ergonomic and performant. As far as the developer is concerned, they should just use the library, not have to learn a load of confusing concepts.\nUnobtrusive: how you structure your application should always be up to you as a development team,  Raid tries to help you create good patterns, but, ultimately, the best patterns for your application require domain knowledge. Raid just handles state changes, you handle how and where those changes occur.\n\n"},"basics/":{"url":"basics/","title":"The Ropes","keywords":"","body":"The Ropes\n\nEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler\n-- Albert Einstein\n\nRaid strives to be unobtrusive, it is little more than a stream that accepts action intents, performs updates to a data structure and then emits that structure so that a view layer can present the data.\nThat’s it.\nThat’s all it does.\nIt massages data and emits events when changes occur.\nDo one thing and do it well.\nThe pattern Raid builds upon has a few advantages:\n\nIt’s simple, the learning curve for Raid is shallow, although some knowledge of functional programming is helpful.\nUpdating the state tree happens via update functions, separating presentational and business logic. Whilst immutable data structures are not required they do fit well with this pattern.\nYour view layer becomes dumb, simply concerned only with it’s presentational logic.

Raid uses the term signal to refer to a stream that emits update events with a new data tree.\nimport {Signal} from 'raid'\n\nconst signal = new Signal()\n\nWe’ll only add complexity when there is no other choice so creating just one state tree and using that for the entire state of our application means that we only have one place to listen to for changes.\nObserving state changes\nWe can respond to any change in the state tree by observing the signal and triggering a top-level render.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {render} from 'react-dom'\nimport {Signal} from 'raid'\n\nconst signal = new Signal({})\n\nconst App = props => {\n  return (\n    Hello Raid\n  )\n}\n\nsignal.observe(state => {\n  render(\n    ,\n    document.getElementById('main')\n  )\n})\n\nWe have created our state tree by creating a new signal and passed in an initial state for our application, in this case an empty object. We then listen for changes to that state by observing the signal, triggering a top-down render of our application.\nPassing state through our application\nFrom this start we can pass our application state through our components via their properties.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {render} from 'react-dom'\nimport {Signal} from 'raid'\n\nconst signal = new Signal({\n  name: 'Joe'\n})\n\nconst Message = ({name}) => {`Hello ${name}`}\nconst App = ({state}) => \n\nsignal.observe(state => {\n  render(\n    ,\n    document.getElementById('main')\n  )\n})\n\nUpdating the state\nThe next part of the puzzle is to separate our presentational logic from our business logic by moving our update functions into their own sphere of influence. This helps encapsulate each section of our application and allows us to reason more easily about data flow and state changes during the lifetime of our application.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {render} from 'react-dom'\nimport {Signal} from 'raid'\n\nconst signal = new Signal({\n  name: 'Joe'\n})\n\nconst Message = ({name}) => {`Hello ${name}`}\nconst App = ({state}) => \n\nconst update = (state, event) => {\n  if (event.type === 'CHANGE_NAME') {\n    state.name = event.payload.name\n    return state\n  }\n\n  return state\n}\n\nsignal.register(update)\n\nsignal.observe(state => {\n  render(\n    ,\n    document.getElementById('main')\n  )\n})\n\nUpdate functions require two parameters, the state they operate against and the event that they will query to see if they should perform any update. An application can have any number of update functions, feel free to use as many as you need, keeping each update function small is usually a good way to go but group functionality as you see fit.\nAll paths out of an update function should return some sort of state, usually adding return state to any control path is enough to ensure the old state is propagated when no updates have occurred.\nUpdates must be registered with the signal so that the signal knows to route action events through the update functions before emitting a new state tree based on the output of those updates.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is to start emitting action events.\nEmitting actions\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {render} from 'react-dom'\nimport {Signal} from 'raid'\n\nconst signal = new Signal({\n  name: 'Joe'\n})\n\nconst Message = ({name}) => {`Hello ${name}`}\nconst App = ({state}) => \n\nconst update = (state, event) => {\n  if (event.type === 'CHANGE_NAME') {\n    state.name = event.payload.name\n    return state\n  }\n\n  return state\n}\n\nsignal.register(update)\n\nsignal.observe(state => {\n  render(\n    ,\n    document.getElementById('main')\n  )\n})\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  signal.emit({\n    type: 'CHANGE_NAME',\n    payload: {\n      name: 'Josie'\n    }\n  })\n}, 3000)\n\nActions are represented as plain objects, by convention the example above shows an object with type and payload members, but there is no enforcement here, use whatever structure makes sense for your application.\nIn this example an action event is triggered after 3 seconds, which propagates through the single update function, causing a mutation to the application state, which then gets emitted from the signal stream, whereby the application can respond to the change and trigger a re-render.\nThe flow of data through the application always remains consistent:\nIntent => Consequence\nThis simple flow usually consists of three parts:\nAction => Update => Render\nThese three steps are clearly modelled within a signal via the emit, register and observe methods which allow this life cycle to play out in our application.\n"},"concepts/concerning-immutability.html":{"url":"concepts/concerning-immutability.html","title":"Concerning Immutability","keywords":"","body":"Concerning Immutability\nImmutable data structures can help us to create simpler applications by being able to rely on the state of data at any point in time. When coupled with top-down rendering suddenly we have the ability to reason about the affects our actions will take on our state and be confident that our state remains consistent across as it traverses our view layer.\nRaid doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel and builds on top of the work done on immutablejs and immstruct to create a centralised state implementation that emits events when it has been updated.\n“It’s Alive!”\nIf you’ve never worked with immutable data structures then getting your head around how to create changes, or mutations, in your data (and therefore your state in this case) is crucial in getting your application to respond to actions.\n\nImmutable data structures can not be changed.\n\nYep, I think we got that one.\nSo, when we want to our application to respond to events we need to recreate the entire state tree and pass that to our rendering to see the update of our action.\nSounds expensive right? Well, it is, or, more accurately, it can be.\nImmutableJS has done a lot of work to make this process as efficient as possible by reusing parts of the previous state tree that have not changed. There are some advantages here too in that testing for changes to your data structure becomes significantly easier, again, ImmutableJS handles this and Raid is just able to use that functionality by accepting a new state object to emit whenever you are processing an action.\nReferential Transparency\nI promise the long words are going to stop soon.\nReferential transparency, or, pure functions, are simply functions which produce no side effects, their output remains consistent when called with a given set of inputs and they touch only their own inputs. Use of referentially transparent functions liberally throughout an application, but in particular use in our update and render functions, can help create a predictable application by helping us to strictly manage where and how changes occur.\nHaving a predictable state tree is great for developers, the advantages of being able to say \"Something has changed, now render everything\" are great as we don’t have to concern ourselves with working out what changed, or even why, or how it relates to the previous state, we simply render whatever our data is currently saying. We stay firmly in the present.\nSimply rendering everything whenever any change occurs is sometimes fast enough, but, ordinarily, it is a huge overdraw, which usually leads to poor rendering performance. Thankfully, there are some things we can do about that.\nRaid was built with React in mind and as the structure is immutable we can make some predictions about the state of the render tree and try to reduce any overdraw resulting from top-down rendering.\nA quick recap on React rendering.\nReact implements a virtual DOM and it uses this tree to make diffs and try to work out what has changed. It does this by comparing properties passed to components. Out of the box React must at least check every component to see if it has changed before deciding how to proceed, this is actually fairly fast but we can make it faster. The problem React has is that if components have their own state then we can not make predictions about child nodes based on parent props so we must evaluate every node for changes before batching only those changes that result in operations on the DOM. By moving individual component state into a centralised state and passing state through to components via render properties we can remove this restriction and employ much faster techniques to assert changes to branches of our state diagram.\nAn immutable state tree means that any operation on data creates a new state tree which we can evaluate from the top-down, as properties are passed from parent to child through the render tree we can make the assertion that if a parent’s properties do not change then neither have their children and skip rendering that entire subtree.\nReact implements this using a pure render mixin that can make this evaluation really fast, if, and only if, it can be sure that stuff further down the tree has not changed.\nRaid also intones that update functions should also be pure, they are handed the state tree and an event to work against and that should be all they require to make changes to the state tree and return a new version of it. Whilst not a requirement for Raid, Immutability can help here as it will eliminate the chance of rogue state changes creeping in to our view layer when we are preparing data for render and give components freedom to make any changes they need to before preparation without risk of mutating the same data structure (or parts of a data structure) used by a different component. State becomes consistent and updates occur in one place.\n"}}}
