/**
 * The useSignal hook lets a component use a react hook (rather than
 * using the adaptor HOC or direct access) to interface with a signal.
 *
 * Each `useSignal` internally manages state and will trigger renders
 * when that state changes, which means you can forego manually
 * calling render for the entire app.
 *
 * Combining signals within a component will also keep the UI fresh.
