# immreact

> Centralised immutable data structure for use with React and Flux

Made possible by the great work by the [immstruct](https://github.com/omniscientjs/immstruct) team.

Current version is 0.0.1, hence the lack of documentation and some oddities in the codebase.

Issues are welcome, but open one before issuing a PR at this stage please.
